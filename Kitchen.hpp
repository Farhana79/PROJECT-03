 * @brief This file contains the declaration of the Kitchen class, which inherits from ArrayBag<Dish>.
 *
 * The Kitchen class is responsible for managing a collection of Dish objects in a virtual kitchen. It includes methods
 * for adding and removing dishes, calculating preparation times, counting elaborate dishes, and generating kitchen reports.
